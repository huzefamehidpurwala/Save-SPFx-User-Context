| FR001          | POST API Endpoint for Receiving Context     | As a developer, I want an API endpoint to receive SharePoint context data from a WebPart.                              | Expose a POST endpoint (e.g., `/api/user-context`) that accepts context data from SharePoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| FR002          | Azure Table Storage for Persistence         | As a developer, I want to store user data in Azure Storage Table using credentials from environment variables.         | On receiving data, use Azure Storage Table to store or update the user record. Table storage credentials (account name, access key, table name) will be read from the `.env` file.                                                                                                                                  |
| FR003          | Immediate Success Response                  | As a WebPart developer, I want the API to respond immediately so the front-end is not blocked by server processing.    | The API should **always return an HTTP 200 OK** status with a success message, regardless of whether backend storage was successful.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| FR004          | Logging of Errors                           | As a developer, I want any failures in writing to the table to be logged for debugging purposes.                       | If the user data could not be saved due to a storage or server error, log the full error stack (with timestamps and context) in a local file or logging service.                                                                                                                                                    |
| FR005          | Update Existing Entry                       | As a developer, I want to update the last-used timestamp if the user already exists in the database.                   | The system should check for existing user entries (by email + domain) and only update `lastUsedDateTime` and `placesInstalledCount` if needed.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| FR006          | Store Complete User Context                 | As a developer, I want to store all available user metadata from the SharePoint context.                               | The system should persist: `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `fullName`, `siteUrl`, `tenantDomain`, `tenantName`, `installedDateTime`, `lastUsedDateTime`, and any other available fields.                                                                                                                          |
| FR007          | Minimal Required Fields                     | As a developer, I want the API to accept incomplete payloads and still process them as long as key fields are present. | Only `email` and at least one domain (`tenantDomain` or `siteUrl`) are required to process the request. All other fields are optional. Invalid or missing mandatory fields should still return success but must be logged for review.                                                                               |
| FR008          | No Duplicate User Entries                   | As a developer, I want each user to be stored only once across all sites or subsites.                                  | Avoid duplicate entries. Use a composite key of `email` and `tenantDomain` or `siteUrl`. If a new site is detected, increase a `placesInstalledCount` field in the existing record.                                                                                                                                 |
| FR009          | GET API Endpoint (Protected)                | As an admin, I want a protected endpoint to fetch all stored user context data in JSON format.                         | Provide a `GET /api/user-context` endpoint that returns the entire Azure Table content. The route should be protected using a JWT Bearer token.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| FR010          | Authorization via JWT and Static Admin List | As a developer, I want the GET route to be accessible only to approved email addresses extracted from a JWT.           | The server should extract the email from the JWT token and compare it to an in-code email whitelist stored in a separate file (e.g., `allowedAdmins.json`). If the email is not present in that list, return 403 Unauthorized.                                                                                      |
| FR011          | External Email Whitelist File               | As a maintainer, I want the admin access list to be easily modifiable without changing application logic.              | The email whitelist used for route protection should be stored in a standalone file (e.g., `allowedAdmins.json`) that can be edited without touching the business logic.                                                                                                                                            |
| FR012          | Decoupled Data Storage Layer                | As a developer, I want Azure Table logic isolated so I can swap the database later without changing core logic.        | All Azure Table operations (read, write, update, upsert) must be implemented in a **separate file and folder**, e.g., `services/azureTableService.ts`. This will allow the application to switch to a different database (e.g., Cosmos DB, SQL, Firebase) with minimal changes to the routing and controller logic. |
| FR013          | Environment Variables for Configuration     | As a developer, I want to use environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoding sensitive data.              | All sensitive data (e.g., Azure Storage account name, access key, table name) should be stored in a `.env` file and accessed via `process.env` in the code. The application should not expose these values in any public or client-side code.                                                                       |
| FR014          | Error Handling Middleware                   | As a developer, I want to handle errors gracefully and return consistent error responses.                              | Implement an error handling middleware that catches exceptions and returns a structured JSON response with an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 500 for server errors, 400 for bad requests). This middleware should log the error details for debugging purposes.                                                |
